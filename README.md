## CI manual run (Actions -> Workflows)

You can run the CI workflow manually from GitHub UI:

- Go to the repository on GitHub -> `Actions` tab
- Select the `CI` workflow
- Click `Run workflow` and choose branch (e.g., `appmod/java-migration-20251214174735`)

This is useful to test the project in Codespaces or to trigger builds on demand.
